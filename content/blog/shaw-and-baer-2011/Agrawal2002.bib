abstract = {Although much theory depends on the genome-wide rate of deleterious mutations, good estimates of the mutation rate are scarce and remain controversial. Furthermore, mutation rate may not be constant, and a recent study suggests that mutation rates are higher in mildly stressful environments. If mutation rate is a function of condition, then individuals carrying more mutations will tend to be in worse condition and therefore produce more mutations. Here I examine the mean fitnesses of sexual and asexual populations evolving under such condition-dependent mutation rates. The equilibrium mean fitness of a sexual population depends on the shape of the curve relating fitness to mutation rate. If mutation rate declines synergistically with increasing condition the mean fitness will be much lower than if mutation rate declines at a diminishing rate. In contrast, asexual populations are less affected by condition-dependent mutation rates. The equilibrium mean fitness of an asexual population only depends on the mutation rate of the individuals in the least loaded class. Because such individuals have high fitness and therefore a low mutation rate, asexual populations experience less genetic load than sexual populations, thus increasing the twofold cost of sex.},
annote = {no back mutations
no adaptation
no changing environment
no cost of fidelity
the whole discussion assumes SIM but doesn't assume the context of SIM


the idea here is to compare SIM effect on equilibrium mean fitness (mutational load) in asex and sex populaitons, therefore beneficial mutations are NEGLECTED


never the less, if the final statement on asex, that the mean fitness at equilibrium depends on the mutation rate of the least loaded class, then asex populations should do SIM, as hypermutation does not affect the mean fitness},
