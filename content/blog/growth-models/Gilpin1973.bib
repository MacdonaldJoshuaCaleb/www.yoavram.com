abstract = {Very precise data on the dynamics of a competitive system of two species of Drosophila have been obtained. By a curvilinear regression approach, analytical models of competition have been fitted. By statistical and biological criteria of simplicity, reality, generality, and accuracy, the best of these models has been chosen. This model represents an extension of the Lotka-Volterra model of competition; it adds a fourth parameter that controls the degree of nonlinearity in intraspecific growth regulation. It represents a similar extension of the logistic model of population growth.},
