abstract = {Polymorphisms in the rifampin resistance mutation frequency (f) were studied in 696 Escherichia coli strains from Spain, Sweden, and Denmark. Of the 696 strains, 23{\%} were weakly hypermutable (4 x 10(-8) {\textless} or = f {\textless} 4 x 10(-7)), and 0.7{\%} were strongly hypermutable (f {\textgreater} or = 4 x 10(-7)). Weak mutators were apparently more frequent in southern Europe and in blood isolates (38{\%}) than in urinary tract isolates (25{\%}) and feces of healthy volunteers (11{\%}).},
