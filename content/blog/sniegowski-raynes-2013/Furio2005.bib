abstract = {It is often argued that high mutation rates are advantageous for RNA viruses, because they confer elevated rates of adaptation. However, there is no direct evidence showing a positive correlation between mutation and adaptation rates among RNA viruses. Moreover, theoretical work does not argue in favor of this prediction. We used a series of vesicular stomatitis virus clones harboring single amino acid substitutions in the RNA polymerase to demonstrate that changes inducing enhanced fidelity paid a fitness cost, but that there was no positive correlation between mutation an adaptation rates. We demonstrate that the observed mutation rate in vesicular stomatitis virus can be explained by a trade-off between replication rate and replication fidelity.},
annote = {intro
-evidence that mutation rates in RNA viruses are not at their physical limit


results
-8 strains of VSV each with a mutation in the polymerase conferring an anti-mutator state
-measured mutation rates and growth rate
-regression between mutation rate and growth rate (without time to evolve) is positive (Fig 2)
also allowed to evolve in passage in cells
-regression between mutation rate and adaptation rate is negarive (Fig 3)
-no correlation between mutation rate and fitness after evolution
-evolved strains increased mutation rates {\~{}}X2 (Table 2)
-estimate the optimal mutation rate to be 0.16 subtitutions per genome per replication event


discussion
-use of theory and parameter estimation to derive the increase in mean fitness due to lower mutation rates


forces at large:
1. deleterious mutation accumulation: reduction of mutation rate
2. adaptation to new conditions (hitchhiking): increase of mutation rate
3. cost of fidelity: increase of mutation rate


this paper checks (2) and (3) and discusses (1).
it suggests that (3) is stronger than (2) because they find positive correlation of mutation rate and fitness, but a negative correlation of mutation rate and adaptation rate and no correlation of mutation rate and fitness after adaptation.
also found that after evolution, the mutation rate increaed (on average)
all work was done with 8 anti-mutator strains},
