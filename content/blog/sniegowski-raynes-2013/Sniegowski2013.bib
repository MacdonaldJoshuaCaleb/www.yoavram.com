abstract = {Two recent reports combine mutation accumulation and whole-genome sequencing to measure mutation rates in microbes with unusual genome sizes and life cycles. The results are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that genetic drift plays a role in shaping genomic mutation rates across a wide range of taxa.},
