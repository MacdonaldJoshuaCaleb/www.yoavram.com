I study evolutionary biology and cultural evolution using mathematical analysis and computational tools.

Some questions I am interested in:

#### **Evolution & Inheritance**
- How do different inheritance modes (high-fidelity vs. low-fidelity, vertical vs. horizontal) affect adaptation and evolution?
- How do these inheritance modes evolve and co-evolve?

#### **Adaptability & Adaptedness**
- What sets the rate of adaptation? 
- Can the adaptation rate be controlled and manipulated?
- Is there a trade-off between the ability to adapt and the ability to remain adapted?

#### **Forecasting Evolution**
- Can we predict evolutionary outcomes?
- ... time until an outcome?
- ... probability of an outcome?
- Can we use these predictions to change the course of evolution?

#### **Fitness**
- What is fitness? 
- How do different definitions of fitness affect our understanding of evolutionary dynamics?
- How do our models of fitness relate to natural and laboratory settings?

### More details...

During my PhD at Tel Aviv University I have developed a theoretical basis to explain **the evolution of stress-induced mutagenesis** â€“ the phenomena in which stress induces a transient increase in mutation rates. 
Stress-induced mutagenesis is prevalent in bacteria and empirical evidence suggests that it is common in many eukaryote species, from yeast to human cancer cells. 
I used mathematical models and computer simulations to show that (i) **stress-induced mutagenesis is favored by natural selection** ([Ram & Hadany 2012](http://goo.gl/sai3Hk)); (ii) that this is also true in the **presence of rare recombination** (paper submitted); and (iii) that **stress-induced mutagenesis increases the rate of complex adaptation** without reducing the mean fitness of the population ([Ram & Hadany 2014](http://goo.gl/SSH5Uc)). 

Because mutation is a fundamental force in evolution, my PhD research has important consequences for various aspects of biology. 
Most importantly, my research is a crucial theoretical contribution to our understanding that **mutation is more likely to occur in individuals who are mal-adapted to their environments** and therefore are more likely to benefit from it.

In a subsequent postdoc at Tel Aviv University, I focused on how microbial fitness is estimated from experiments. I led a team of collaborators to develop and test a new method for **predicting microbial growth in a mixed culture** solely from growth curve data ([see preprint](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/03/022640)). 
To validate this method, we performed growth curve and competition experiments with bacteria and yeast.
Our new method not only results in a simple and cost-effective approach for estimating growth in a mixed culture and **inferring competitive fitness in microbes**, but also provides information on the specific growth traits that contribute to differences in fitness, thus helping to bridge the gap between population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics.
