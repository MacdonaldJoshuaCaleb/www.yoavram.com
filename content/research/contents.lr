I developed a **theoretical basis** to explain the evolutionary origin of stress-induced mutagenesis and study its effect on adaptation. My results show that **stress-induced mutagenesis is favored by natural selection** in asexual organisms ([Ram & Hadany 2012](http://goo.gl/sai3Hk)) and that it increases the ability of populations to evolve complex adaptations, without jeopardizing their ability to remain adapted to stable environments ([Ram & Hadany 2014](http://goo.gl/SSH5Uc)). This suggests that stress-induced hypermutation should be common in bacteria and other asexual organisms and that it plays an **important role in adaptive evolution**.

My research adds to the ongoing shift in our understanding of mutationâ€”one of the basic forces of evolution. **Contrary to the classical view of mutation** as an inevitable copying error, kept at bay by accurate replication and error-correction mechanisms, it becomes increasingly evident that **mutation rates are controlled and regulated**. These results have important implications for many fields in the medical and life sciences, including epidemiology, oncology, ecology, and evolutionary biology.
