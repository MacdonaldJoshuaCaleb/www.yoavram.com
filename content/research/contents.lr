body:

We study **population biology**, including evolutionary biology, ecology, behaviour, and cultural evolution, using **mathematical, computational, and statistical models** and **collaborations** with experimental biologists.

#### Main interests

- The emergence of competition and cooperation in population dynamics
- The mechanisms that produce and transmit of phenotypic, genetic, and cultural variation
- Model-based analysis of evolutionary and ecological empirical data

#### Research questions

- How do different **inheritance modes** (genetic vs. cultural, small-effect vs. large-effect, high-fidelity vs. low-fidelity, vertical vs. non-vertical) affect evolution?
- How do these **inheritance modes evolve** and co-evolve?
- What are the similarities and differences between **cultural and genetic evolution**?
- How can new insights and models from **machine and deep learning** help us study evolution?
- Which models are best suited to **analyse and interpret empirical evolutionary and ecological data**?
- How can we **integrate different levels of population biology**, especially when analysing experimental and observational results?

### Past research

#### Population genetics
We developed a theoretical basis to explain **the evolution of stress-induced mutagenesis** â€“ the phenomena in which stress induces a transient increase in mutation rates. 
Stress-induced mutagenesis is prevalent in bacteria and in many eukaryote species, from yeast to human cancer cells. 
We used mathematical models and computer simulations to show that (i) **stress-induced mutagenesis is favored by natural selection** ([Ram & Hadany 2012](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01576.x)); that (ii) this is also true in the **presence of rare recombination** ([Ram & Hadany 2019](https://doi.org/10.1086/703457)); that (iii) **stress-induced mutagenesis increases the rate of complex adaptation** without reducing the mean fitness of the population ([Ram & Hadany 2014](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.1025)); and that (iv) errors in regulation of mutagenesis can be compensated by population communication ([Dellus-Gur et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.170529)).

We have also found a general principle underlying this phenomena, which we have termed the **_Modified Mean Fitness Principle_** ([Ram et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2018.02.004)). It determines that if below-average individuals generate more variation (be it genetic or phenotypic) than above-average individuals, then the population mean fitness will increase. The mechanisms for generation of variation are not limited to mutation but rather may include dispersal ([Gueijman et al. 2013](http://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-13-125)), social learning, etc.

#### Cultural evolution
We studied the evolution of **oblique transmission**, in which offspring inherit their phenotype from a non-parental adult rather than their parents. This occurs primarily during social learning, but also in symbiont and pathogen transmission. We found that the evolutionarily stable rate of oblique transmission differs markedly from the rate that maximizes the geometric mean fitness of the population, implying a form of **_prisoner's dilemma_ for social learning** ([Ram, Liberman & Feldman 2018](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1719171115)). We've also studied how fluctuations in the rate of vertical vs. oblique transmission affect trait polymorphism ([Ram, Liberman & Feldman 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2018.11.001)), what happens when the rate of vertical vs. oblique transmission depends on trait frequency ([Liberman, Ram, Altenberg & Feldman 2019](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2019.12.004)), or when transmission is biased towards to more (or less) common phenotype (Krebs Denton, Ram, Liberman, Feldman, _in preparation_).

#### Analysis of evolutionary experiments
We collaborated to develop and test a new method for **predicting growth in a mixed culture** solely from growth curve data ([Ram et al. 2019a](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1902217116), [Ram et al. 2019b](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1917758117)). 
We validated this method by performing growth curve and competition experiments with bacteria.
Our new method not only results in a simple and cost-effective approach for estimating growth in a mixed culture and inferring competitive fitness, but also provides information on the specific growth traits that contribute to differences in fitness, thus helping to **bridge the gap between ecology and evolution**.

We also collaborated with the Kupiec lab at Tel Aviv University to analyse results of evolutionary experiments ([Harari et al. 2018a](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.01.062), [Harari et al. 2018b](http://doi.org/10.1007/s00294-018-0823-y)). In these experiments, haploid yeast cells frequently became diploid via two distinct genetic mechanisms. Using approximate Bayesian approximation (ABC), we estimated the rate of endoreduplication in these experiments, and found that in it was much higher than the mutation rate.
