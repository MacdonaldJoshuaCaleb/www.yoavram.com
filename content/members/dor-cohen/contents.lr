Iâ€™ve recently finished my 6 years army service as a network engineer team lead in the IDF and joined Microsoft as a software engineer intern.

Pursuing my MSc degree in Computer Science at Reichman University (IDC Herzliya), I am studying the field of computational evolution. My research focused on population dynamics and how we can explain natural phenomena using computational evolution.

I live in Ramat Gan with my girlfriend with our dog. Outside work I enjoy running, traveling and hiking.
