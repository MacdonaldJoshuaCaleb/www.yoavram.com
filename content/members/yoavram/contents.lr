body:

I'm a **theoretical population biologist** with a special interest in evolutionary theory, population dynamics, and cultural evolution.

I'm a **mathematician**. I especially like applying probabilistic and statistical models to biological questions.

I'm a **computational scientist**. I use numerical and stochastic simulations, statistics, and data visualization.

I'll be **senior lecturer** at the Efi Arazi School of Computer Science at IDC Herzliya stating Autumn 2018.
I was a CEHG **postdoctoral fellow** at the [Feldman Lab](http://www-evo.stanford.edu/) in Stanford University. I did a direct **Ph.D.** in the [Hadany Lab](http://www.hadanylab.com) at Tel Aviv University and got a **B.Sc.** in math and biology from Tel Aviv University.

I'm also a **technical trainer**. I help engineers and data scientists use [Python](https://python.yoavram.com/) for scientific computation and data science.

I live with my partner, three kids, and two dogs. I enjoy walking, [eating, cooking, and gardening](http://www.thethirdplate.com), listening to [hip-hop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcYoStt25hsfAg8vcaoseSg) and [podcasts](http://soundcloud.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast), reading [space operas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_Wakes), and watching NBA.
