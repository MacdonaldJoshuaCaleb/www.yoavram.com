body:

I recently started a PhD at the Weizmann Institute of Science at the [Pilpel lab](https://longitude.weizmann.ac.il/).
I study how epigenetic inheritance of the mutation rate affects adaptation, using mathematical and computational models.
In the future I plan to combine experimental and theoretical approaches to study _evolvability_.
