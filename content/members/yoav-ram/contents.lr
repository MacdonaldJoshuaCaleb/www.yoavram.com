body:

I'm a **theoretical population biologist** with a special interest in evolution, population dynamics, cultural evolution, infectious diseases, and community ecology.

I'm a **mathematician**. I especially like building mathematical models to study questions in population biology.

I'm a **computational scientist**. I use numerical and stochastic simulations, computational and Bayesian statistics, machine and deep learning, and data visualisation to extract insight from models and data.

I'm a **senior lecturer** (asst. prof.) at the [*School of Zoology*](https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/lp-en-zoology), Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University.
I'm also affiliated with the [*Sagol School of Neuroscience*](https://en-sagol.tau.ac.il/), the [*Safra Center for Bioinformatics*](https://safrabio.cs.tau.ac.il/), and the *Center for Combatting Pandemics* at Tel Aviv University.

I was previously a **senior lecturer** at the [*School of Computer Science*](https://www.idc.ac.il/he/schools/cs/pages/home.aspx), at IDC Herzliya, 
and a CEHG **postdoctoral fellow** in the [Feldman Lab](http://www-evo.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University
I completed a direct **PhD** in the [Hadany Lab](http://www.hadanylab.com) and a **BSc** in math and biology at Tel Aviv University.

I live with my partner, four kids, two dogs, and ~~two~~ four cats.
I enjoy running, cooking, listening to [hip-hop](https://youtu.be/_VklRDoigWs) and [podcasts](http://revisionisthistory.com), [reading](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/12/how-real-world-science-sets-expanse-apart-other-sci-fi-shows), and watching [NBA](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0vbz8zzmhgvcszm/LBJ-AD-champs.png?dl=1).
