body:

I'm a **theoretical biologist** with a special interest in evolutionary theory, population dynamics, and cultural evolution.

I'm a **mathematician**. I especially like applying mathematical and statistical models to questions in population biology.

I'm a **computational scientist**. I use numerical and stochastic simulations, computational statistics, machine and deep learning, and data visualisation to extract insight from models and data.

I'm a **senior lecturer** (asst. prof.) at the [School of Zoology](https://en-lifesci.tau.ac.il/lp-en-zoology), Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University.
I was previously a **senior lecturer** at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.idc.ac.il/he/schools/cs/pages/home.aspx), at IDC Herzliya, 
and a CEHG **postdoctoral fellow** at the [Feldman Lab](http://www-evo.stanford.edu/) in Stanford University
I did a direct **Ph.D.** in the [Hadany Lab](http://www.hadanylab.com) at Tel Aviv University and got a **B.Sc.** in math and biology from Tel Aviv University.

I'm also a **technical trainer**. I help engineers, analysts, and data scientists use [Python](https://python.yoavram.com/) for scientific computation and data science.

I live with my partner, four kids, two dogs, and two cats.
I enjoy walking, [eating, cooking, and gardening](http://www.thethirdplate.com), listening to [hip-hop](https://youtu.be/_VklRDoigWs) and [podcasts](http://soundcloud.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast), [reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy), and watching [NBA](https://www.nba.com/lakers/releases/180709-lakers-sign-lebron-james).
