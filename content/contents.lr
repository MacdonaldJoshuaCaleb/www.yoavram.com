body:

We study **evolutionary biology, ecology, and cultural evolution** using **mathematical, computational, and statistical models** and **collaborations with experimental biologists**.

We are located at the [Efi Arazi School of Computer Science](http://idc.ac.il/en/schools/cs) at [IDC Herzliya](http://idc.ac.il).

**We are hiring** undergraduate, master, and PhD students, postdoctoral fellows and research assistants, including for short periods. If you are interested, please email [Yoav](mailto:yoav@yoavram.com).

### News

- A new paper, the product of a collaboration with the Kupiec lab at Tel Aviv University, demonstrates that [yeast frequently become diploid in the lab](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.01.062).
- My second postdoc paper presents a [_modified mean fitness principle_ for the generation of genetic and phenotypic variation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2018.02.004).
- My first postdoc paper, on [evolution of non-vertical inheritance in changing environments](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/22/1719171115), was published in PNAS! You can also view a [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/yoavram/evolution-of-non-vertical-inheritance-in-changing-environments#) I gave about our results at the Weizmann Institute for Science.
