#### <i class="fa fa-flask"></i> Evolution in Culture & Cultural Evolution <i class="fae fae-brain"></i>

We study **evolutionary biology, ecology, and cultural evolution** using **mathematical, computational, and statistical models** and **collaborations with experimental biologists**. See the [research page](/research) to read more about our research interests and projects.

We are part of the [Efi Arazi School of Computer Science](http://idc.ac.il/en/schools/cs) at [IDC Herzliya](http://idc.ac.il).

If you are interested in joining us, please email [Yoav](mailto:yoav@yoavram.com).

### News

- The ISF has accepted our grant proposal on _the role of aneuploidy in adaptive evolution_!
- The _Society for the Study of Evolution_ has a [New Faculty Profile](http://www.evolutionsociety.org/content/new-faculty-profiles/new-faculty-profile-yoav-ram.html) on Yoav.
- [Predicting microbial relative growth in a mixed culture from growth curve data](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1902217116  ) is now published in _PNAS_: this is the result of a long collaboration with Eynat Dellus-Gur, Maayan Bibi, Uri Obolski, Judith Berman and Lilach Hadany from Tel Aviv University, Marc Feldman from Stanford University, and Kedar Karkare and Tim Cooper from the University of Houston.
- A new paper on [evolution of stress-induced mutation with horizontal gene transfer](https://doi.org/10.1086/703457) is now published on _The American Naturalist_.
- Yoav presented our work at the [Molecular Mechanisms in Evolution _Gordon Research Conference_](https://www.grc.org/molecular-mechanisms-in-evolution-conference/2019/).
- Less fit Lamium plants produce more dispersible seeds: they produce more unspotted seeds, which germinate slower and are preferred by harvester ants over spotted seed. Read about it in [our new paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-42158-1).
- Yoav presented some preliminary results on evolution of aneuploidy in the [annual meeting of the _Israeli Society of Microbiology_](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/conferences/ISM2019/).
- New paper on cultural evolution with fluctuating transmission rates was accepted by _TPB_ and is now [available online](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2018.11.001).
- The Ram Lab officially opened on October 1st!
- Yoav presented at the Genome Evolution Conference at the Weizmann Institute for Science. You are welcome to view the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/yoavram/evolution-of-non-vertical-inheritance-in-changing-environments#).
- A new paper published in _Current Biology_, the product of a collaboration with the Kupiec lab at Tel Aviv University, demonstrates that [yeast frequently become diploid in the lab](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.01.062).
- In a new _TPB_ paper we presented a [_modified mean fitness principle_ for the generation of genetic and phenotypic variation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2018.02.004).
- Our paper on the [evolution of non-vertical inheritance in changing environments](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/22/1719171115), was published in _PNAS_!
