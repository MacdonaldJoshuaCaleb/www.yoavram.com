body:

We study **population biology**, including evolutionary biology, ecology, behaviour, and cultural evolution, using **mathematical, computational, and statistical models** and **collaborations** with experimental biologists.
See the [research page](/research) to read more about our research interests and projects.

We are part of the [Efi Arazi School of Computer Science](http://idc.ac.il/en/schools/cs) at [IDC Herzliya](http://idc.ac.il).
