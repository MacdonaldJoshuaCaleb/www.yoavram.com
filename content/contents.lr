title: I'm Yoav.
---
body:

I'm a **biologist** with a special interest in evolutionary theory, population dynamics, and cultural evolution.

I'm a **mathematician**. I especially like applying probabilistic and statistical models to biological questions.

I'm a **computational scientist**. I use numerical and stochastic simulations, statistics, and data visualization.

I'm a CEHG **postdoctoral fellow** at the [Feldman Lab](http://www-evo.stanford.edu/) in Stanford University. I did my Ph.D. in the [Hadany Lab](http://www.hadanylab.com) at Tel Aviv University and got a B.Sc. in math and biology from Tel Aviv University.

I'm also a **technical trainer**. I help engineers and data scientists use [Python](https://python.yoavram.com/) for scientific computation and data science.

I live with my partner, three kids, and two dogs. I enjoy walking, [eating, cooking, and gardening](http://www.thethirdplate.com), listening to [hip-hop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcYoStt25hsfAg8vcaoseSg) and [podcasts](http://soundcloud.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast), reading [space operas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_Wakes), and watching NBA.

### News

A new paper, the product of a collaboration with the Kupiec lab at Tel Aviv University, demonstrates that [yeast frequently become diploid in the lab](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.01.062).

My second postdoc paper presents a [_modified mean fitness principle_ for the generation of genetic and phenotypic variation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2018.02.004).

My first postdoc paper, on [evolution of non-vertical inheritance in changing environments](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/22/1719171115), was published in PNAS! You can also view a [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/yoavram/evolution-of-non-vertical-inheritance-in-changing-environments#) I gave about our results at the Weizmann Institute for Science.
