#### <i class="fa fa-flask"></i> Evolution in Culture & Cultural Evolution <i class="fae fae-brain"></i>

We study **evolutionary biology, ecology, and cultural evolution** using **mathematical, computational, and statistical models** and **collaborations with experimental biologists**. See the [research page](/research) to read more about our research interests and projects.

The lab is part of the [Efi Arazi School of Computer Science](http://idc.ac.il/en/schools/cs) at [IDC Herzliya](http://idc.ac.il).

We are looking for undergraduate, master, and PhD students, postdoctoral fellows and research assistants, including for short periods. If you are interested, please email [Yoav](mailto:yoav@yoavram.com).

### News

- Yoav will present our work at the [Molecular Mechanisms in Evolution Gordon Research Conference](https://www.grc.org/molecular-mechanisms-in-evolution-conference/2019/) in June.
- Less fit Lamium plants produce more dispersible seeds: they produce more unspotted seeds, which germinate slower and are preferred by harvester ants over spotted seed. Read about in [our new paper](http://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-42158-1).
- Yoav presented some preliminary results on evolution of aneuploidy in the [annual meeting of the Israeli Society of Microbiology](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/conferences/ISM2019/).
